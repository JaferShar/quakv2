ðŸ§  Quantum IDE Web Editor

This project is a web-based Quantum IDE designed to support intuitive quantum programming. It integrates:

    QLP Text Editor â€“ for writing code in a quantum programming language.

    Qubit Circuit Builder â€“ a graphical interface to build quantum circuits.

    Other views like the mathematical representation and the quanten possibilities

    Multidirectional Sync â€“ any change in the code updates the circuit, etc.

The goal is to bridge textual and visual quantum programming, making development easier for both beginners and experts.
